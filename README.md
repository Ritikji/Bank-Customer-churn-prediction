# Bank-Customer-churn-prediction
ANN implementation using Keras

**Problem Statement** :

Customer churn or customer attrition is a tendency of clients or customers to abandon a brand and stop being a paying client of a particular business or organization. The percentage of customers that discontinue using a company’s services or products during a specific period is called a customer churn rate. Several bad experiences (or just one) are enough, and a customer may quit. And if a large chunk of unsatisfied customers churn at a time interval, both material losses and damage to reputation would be enormous.

A reputed bank “ABC BANK” wants to predict the Churn rate. Create a model by using different machine learning approaches that can predict the best result.

**Dataset Description** :

This is a public dataset, The dataset format is given below.

Inside the dataset, there are 10000 rows and 14 different columns.

The target column here is Exited here.


**Keras:**

Keras is a high-level, deep learning API developed by Google for implementing neural networks. It is written in Python and is used to make the implementation of neural networks easy. It also supports multiple backend neural network computation.


**Keras allows you to switch between different back ends. The frameworks supported by Keras are:**

    Tensorflow

    Theano

    PlaidML

    MXNet

    CNTK (Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit )


**Why Do We Need Keras?**

Keras is an API that was made to be easy to learn for people. Keras was made to be simple. It offers consistent & simple APIs, reduces the actions required to implement common code, and explains user error clearly.

Prototyping time in Keras is less. This means that your ideas can be implemented and deployed in a shorter time. Keras also provides a variety of deployment options depending on user needs.

Languages with a high level of abstraction and inbuilt features are slow and building custom features in then can be hard. But Keras runs on top of TensorFlow and is relatively fast. Keras is also deeply integrated with TensorFlow, so you can create customized workflows with ease.

The research community for Keras is vast and highly developed. The documentation and help available are far more extensive than other deep learning frameworks.

Keras is used commercially by many companies like Netflix, Uber, Square, Yelp, etc which have deployed products in the public domain which are built using Keras.

**Apart from this, Keras has features such as :**

    It runs smoothly on both CPU and GPU.

    It supports almost all neural network models.

    It is modular in nature, which makes it expressive, flexible, and apt for innovative research.


**Applications of Keras**

    Keras is used for creating deep models which can be productized on smartphones.


    Keras is also used for distributed training of deep learning models.

    Keras is used by companies such as Netflix, Yelp, Uber, etc.

    Keras is also extensively used in deep learning competitions to create and deploy working models, which are fast in a short amount of time.
